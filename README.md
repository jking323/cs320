I have learned a lot in this course and with this project. I don't write a lot of OOP for work so this was interesting to refresh. I have never used JUnit before either,
This is a powerful tool that I will utilize when I write Java.

* How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

  Unit testing is very important, ensuring I write secure code free of memory leaks of bugs that could allow access to unintended areas.
* How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

  I would interpret user needs from my point of view and through feedback from the users themselves. I can never simulate every user but taking the consensus is a valuable tool.
* How do I approach designing software?

  I approach it with the mindset that I will never be able to please every user and I have to prepare for feedback that I may not agree with.
